Keys are sent with low latency via tmux control mode, but the preview refresh causes UI flicker.\n\n## Problem\nWhen in passthrough mode, the UI flickers/jumps ~10 pixels vertically on each keystroke or refresh.\n\n## What we've tried\n1. **tmux control mode** - Replaced exec per keystroke with persistent control connection. Keys send in ~18µs vs 57ms. ✅ Fixed latency, but flicker remains.\n\n2. **Fast polling (50ms)** - Refreshed preview every 50ms. Caused heavy flicker.\n\n3. **On-demand refresh** - Only refresh after keystroke with 30-100ms delay. Still flickers.\n\n4. **Skip refresh if content unchanged** - Added check `if m.preview != msg.output`. Helped slightly.\n\n5. **Debouncing** - Track `passthroughPending` to only schedule one refresh per 100ms window. Reduced flicker but didn't eliminate.\n\n6. **Clear status message** - Set `m.statusMessage = \"\"` during passthrough to stabilize view state. Minor improvement.\n\n7. **Fixed height view** - Used `lipgloss.Place(width, height, ...)` to anchor view to terminal size. Still flickers.\n\n## Suspected causes\n- Bubbletea re-renders on every Update() call regardless of view changes\n- Something in header/status bar changing height between renders\n- View caching not working properly (statusExpired computed with time.Now())\n\n## Potential solutions to explore\n- Use Bubbletea viewport component for preview (isolates scrolling)\n- Investigate what's changing between renders with debug logging\n- Try tea.WithoutRenderer and manual ANSI cursor positioning\n- Consider not refreshing preview at all during passthrough (accept stale view)\n- Profile View() output to find what's different between frames","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"software@jayphen.com","created_at":"2026-01-25T00:11:31.14485+11:00","created_by":"Jayphen","updated_at":"2026-01-25T00:11:31.14485+11:00","labels":["tui"]}

Session should be tracked in memory (and optionally persisted)\n3. --attach flag should work with direct PTY attach\n4. Backward compatibility: maybe keep tmux as fallback with --tmux flag\n\nThis enables the no-tmux workflow where sessions are managed directly.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"software@jayphen.com","created_at":"2026-01-25T01:20:49.28819+11:00","created_by":"Jayphen","updated_at":"2026-01-25T01:27:32.237831+11:00","closed_at":"2026-01-25T01:27:32.237831+11:00","close_reason":"Implemented --pty flag for direct PTY spawn.
